Poll #3:
In the previous poll, people voted which albums are they least favorites...
This poll (maybe the last shitty poll) has a twist and will have a surprise as result!
These options are tracks from The Endless River, A momentary lapse of reason, The Final Cut,
Ummagumma (studio only) & More.
Pick 3 tracks to be saved to humanity, the rest will be erased forever from history.
Choose wisely.
Don't do a mess.
Music history is in game.
