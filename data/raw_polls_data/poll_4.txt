Poll #4:
In a previous post, we were talking about most hated songs. Most of the mentioned songs are listed in this poll.
Pick up to 3 songs/tracks to be deleted forever from existence.
Could be songs you hate the most or you don't care if disappears.
If you have in mind other options, please add them by yourself
(please don't add stupid options like "Ummagumma" or "David's discography", I will delete 'em.
If you hate an entire suite, it's valid to say "Shine on you crazy diamond" or "Sisyphus").
